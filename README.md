# Open Component Model action

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/open-component-model/ocm-action)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/open-component-model/ocm-action)


This action installs a dedicated version of the OCM tool and executes the
operation specified with the `action` input.
All paths are evaluated relative to the workdir.

## Prerequisites

The `ocm`command line tool must be installed.
This can be done with the action [`open-component-model/ocm-setup-action`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-setup-action).

## Inputs

**Required** The action to execute.

Possible actions are

|Action|Meaning|Inputs|

|`add_resources`|add resources/references to an already existing or new component| `directory`, `component`, `version`, `provider`, `resources`, `references`, `settigs` |
|`add_component`|add a component to an extisting or new transport archive| `directory`, `ctf` |
|`push_ctf`|push the transport archive. If it does not exist and a component directory is given, the actual component will be used to create the transport archive.| `directory`, `ctf`, `comprepo_url`, `comprepo_user`, `comprepo_password` |

### `directory`

**Optional** Will be defaulted to `gen/ocm/component`, if input is required by action.

The directory to generate the component information

### `component`

**Optional** The component name. If not given the component name is derived from

file is checked and appended by the commit id.

### `version_file`

**Optional** The filename used to lookup the actual version. Default `VERSION`.

### `version_cmd`

**Optional** A command called to determine the version of the component to create.

### `provider`

### `resources`

**Optional** The resource specification file describing the resources to add.
If not specified it checks for `gen/ocm/resources.yaml` and `ocm/resources.yaml`.

### `comprepo_url`

**Optional for** `push_ctf`. The base URL for the used component repository.

### `comprepo_user`

**Optional for** `push_ctf`. The username used to access the component repository.
The default is the owner of the actually built repository.

### `comprepo_password`

**Required for** `push_ctf`. The password used to access the component repository.
The default is the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable of the actually built repository.
It requires packages write permission.

## Outputs

### `component-name`

The (optional) effective component name.

### `component-version`

The (optional) effective component version.

### `component-path`

The (optional) workspace relative path of the generated component directory.

### `transport-archive`
